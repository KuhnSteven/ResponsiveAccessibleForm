# ResponsiveAccessibleForm
This project is intended to simulate a shopping cart checkout form. The first intent is to have a fully responsive form, that fits both mobile and desktop (mobile 1st). The second intent, is that any obvious accessibility flaws should be met, to make the form/website as user-friendly as possible.
